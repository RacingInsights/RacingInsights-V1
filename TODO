Possible next TODOs:
PRIO: 
- Still need to include the refactored implementation of saving the logged relative estimation data to dynamoDB.
- Add functionality that app can be opened as tray icon without the need for the main dashboard to open up every time
  (https://youtu.be/BdQOFOyHgfk)
- Spectator support. Refuel amount doesn't work for this yet

PRODUCTION:
- obfuscate credential string in code
- Remove scenario_freezer and make sure we don't build its additional packages (keyboard, remove also from requirements)
- Add some more data validation (min-max) for loading the config 
- Needs to get access through firewall because of the https calls (possible using an installer?)

BUGS:
- When driving in team event:
    - Names do not always match (displays name of first driver in car or something)
- when opening other overlay application, mine gets minimized to the background, is there a way to prevent?
- scenario freezer doesn't respond to key presses when app was already opened before entering iRacing sim

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Overlays get minimized when alt tabbing from game, need to be reopened to appear again
- Make it possible to set the width of the entire overlay fixed, even when removing columns
- RelativeScreen: Add option to
    - toggle car number box activation
    - choose to show live position/over-the-line position
- Make a dark titlebar
- Fix bug that correct app icon only shows in main screen taskbar and not second screen taskbar (normal python app logo)
- Color blindness

OPTIONAL:
- Add scenario freeze to exception logging (minus the screenshot)

NEXT STEPS:
- Windows certificate?
- BTW nummer/eenmanszaak openen
- Web site
- Build remaining overlays:
    Standard ideas:
        - The radar with the bar like in Kapps
        - Standings
        - Pit window indicator 
        - Track map
            - Mike's idea of corner names showing up when driving (to learn them)
        - Driver inputs (pedals, steering)
        - Tire indicator
        - ABS/TC lights
    Innovative ideas:
        - Excess steering indicator
        - Situational Awareness (Radar for cars around like ACC)
        - Remaining track space indicator (distance between car edge and grass/end of road surface)
        - Beep when throttle and brake at the same time (Tobias idea)

- Data collection in cloud:
    - Save the config_data.yaml data in a database after user closes their app
