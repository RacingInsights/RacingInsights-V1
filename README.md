# iRacing-overlays
## Goal:

 Project that serves as an exercise to go through all the steps of building a software product: from an app idea to the delivery to the 'User'
 
## Folder structure:

/src                        -> Contains the source code of the app

RacingInsightsApp.py        -> Main file that runs the app

/images                     -> The official images that are used and linked by the application

/docs                       -> All documentation build up during the development

/example code               -> Random examples that might be useful as a reference

/tests                      -> Contains the tests 

/logs                       -> Contains anything related to logging the (performance) of the app

/setup                      -> Files related to the setup of the app. aka making the installer for the executable.

## Current MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

*fuel calculation overlay that tells the user their 2 fuel targets closest to their current average consumption (current laps floored, current laps ceiling)*
